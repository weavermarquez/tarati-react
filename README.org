We are going to use the canvas HTML element.
**** Learn Canvas Element
https://medium.com/@pdx.lucasm/canvas-with-react-js-32e133c05258

Using Canvas in react requires a number of React features
=useRef=
- The canvas element itself is a DOM node that you need to reference directly
- You'll be doing imperative drawing operations (like =ctx.drawRect()=)
- You don't want React to re-render when you draw - you want to control the drawing manually

=useEffect= allows us to perform side effects in function components - in particular, to do something after the component is mounted (first rendered).

*** Let's import a couple of libraries:

** Questions
- [X] I'm currently learnining about the HTML canvas element. It's using a feature called =useRef= from React, but I'm not quite understanding it. It's essentially =useState= but for state variables that are /not/ needed for rendering? Then why not just use const?
  Okay, so useRef is for values that /persist across renders/ but do not trigger renders.
  Const creates a new variable on every render. It does not persist; it must be re-calculated.

- component mounting :: a component's first render.
